<p>KK and KV are playing a new game involving an <span
class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> grid of boxes. KV starts by
placing a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or a <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> anywhere in the grid. KK then follows
by again placing a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or a <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in any of the remaining spaces. This
continues until there is no spaces left. The goal of the game is
determined by the determinant of the resultant <span
class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix. If the determinant is
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, KK wins, else KV wins. Assuming
both KK and KV play optimally, who would win and why?</p>

<h2 id="death-by-intuition">Death by Intuition</h2>
<p>You learnt about vectors in physics. Now let’s play with them in
math. Let us define an operator <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda:
\mathbb{V} \times \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{V}\)</span> which is
distributive, associative, anti-symmetric <em>(If you wish to understand
what these terms mean <a
href="http://brandnew2000.github.io/mc/dc_web/add" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click
here</a>.</em>) and follows: <span
class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{e_1}\Lambda \mathbf{e_2}\Lambda .....
\Lambda \mathbf{e_n}|=1\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{e_i}\)</span> are orthogonal unit vectors
in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{V}\)</span> i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{e_i} \cdot \mathbf{e_j} = 0  \ \ \forall \
i\neq j\)</span>. You would have encountered some of them in Cartesian
3D where (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{e_1,e_2,e_3}\)</span>)=(<span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i,j,k}\)</span>).<br />
<br />
Now let’s try and intuitively understand operator <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assume two 2D vectors <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v_1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v_2}\)</span>. Can you somehow relate
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v_1} \Lambda \mathbf{v_2}\)</span>
to the cross product? Can you interpret it geometrically? (1
point)</p></li>
<li><p>Can you extend your previous result to three dimensions? (i.e
what do you expect <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v_1}\Lambda
\mathbf{v_2} \Lambda \mathbf{v_3}\)</span> to be geometrically?) Now
prove it.(2 points)</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v_i} := (v_{i1}, v_{i2},
..... v_{in})\)</span>. Can you represent <span
class="math inline">\(\left(\mathbf{v_1}\Lambda \mathbf{v_2}\Lambda
..... \Lambda \mathbf{v_n}\right)\)</span> in terms of the components of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v_i}\text{ ; } i=1,2,3...n\)</span>
without any vector operations in some compact form. (Hint: Think of
matrices and the cases you proved above.) Proof is not necessary (but
will earn brownie points :)). Intuition is sufficient. (2
points)</p></li>
<li><p>Using the result in the previous part, can you prove a property
about <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dt}\left(\mathbf{v_1}\Lambda
\mathbf{v_2}\Lambda ..... \Lambda \mathbf{v_n}\right)\)</span> given
that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v_k}\)</span> are dependent on
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.(1 points)</p></li>

<h1 id="a-network-of-connections">§4  A Network of Connections</h1>
<p>Graphs aren’t just for math—they’re everywhere! They help us
understand how things are connected and interact. A Graph is nothing but
like a network of friends. Each friend is a node and the connections
between them are represented by edges. Here are a few definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vertices (or Nodes): These are the points in a graph. Think of
each person as a vertex.</p></li>
<li><p>Edges: These are the lines that connect two vertices. For example
an edge shows that two people are friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Degree of a vertex: This tells us how many edges are connected to
a vertex. In other words, the degree of a person (vertex) is how many
friends they have.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Exploring Degree Sum and Number of Edges:</strong> Now
that we know what vertices, edges, and degrees are, let’s dig a little
deeper! Can you figure out how the sum of all degrees relates to the
total number of edges (friendships) in the network? In other words
imagine you have a network of friends. Each person (vertex) has a
certain number of friends (degree). If we add up the number of friends
everyone has, how can we figure out the total number of friendships? (2
points)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chessboard with Graphs:</strong> We can model the
chessboard as a graph in which each square is represented as a node. An
edge connects two nodes if a knight can legally move from one square to
the other. Your goal is to investigate the characteristics of this graph
representing the knight’s movement!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the graph <a
href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BipartiteGraph.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bipartite</a>?
If it is Bipartite, try to give a Bipartition, else explain why. (2
points)</p></li>
<li><p>In general, try to think of a condition for a graph to be
bipartite. (2 points)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hamiltonian and Eulerian:</strong> A graph is called
Hamiltonian if there exists a cycle (called a Hamiltonian cycle) that
visits every vertex of the graph exactly once and returns to the
starting vertex.</p>
<p>A graph is called Eulerian if there exists a <a
href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuit</a> (called an
Eulerian circuit) that traverses every edge of the graph exactly once
and returns to the starting vertex.</p>
<p>Now consider the graph G:<br />

<ol>
<li><p>Determine whether the graph G is Hamiltonian (Give a Hamiltonian
cycle if it exists).(2 points)</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the graph is Eulerian. What is a necessary condition
for any graph to be Eulerian?(2 points)</p></li>
</ol></li>

<h1 id="the-limits-of-logic">§5  The Limits of Logic</h1>
<p>Logical reasoning forms a very important part of framing mathematical
arguments. This is an essential skill that helps you in proving and
disproving claims that your fellow math enthusiasts may make (and is
also helpful in proving that your friend is an RG). This section is
designed to test how well you observe a given problem and how well you
are able to put forth your arguments in favour of a claim.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Function foundry:</strong> Let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{A} \subset \mathbb{R_+}\)</span>, that is
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{A}\)</span> is a subset of the
positive reals. Now <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{A}
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> is a function that satisfies the
condition: <span class="math display">\[f(x)f(y) = \frac{1}{x+y}
\forall x, y \in \mathbb{A}\]</span> Find a
function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> along with your choice
of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{A}\)</span> which satisfy the
aforementioned condition. (3 points)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Back to basics:</strong> Let <span
class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{R_+} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> be given
by <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x - \frac{1}{x}\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R_+}\)</span>. Now let <span
class="math display">\[g(x) = f\left(f(x)\right) -
f\left(f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right)\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is defined on the most exhaustive
domain possible. What kind of function is <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>? Is <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> a special kind of function? (2
points)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proof Theory!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The easy one:</strong> In a group of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> friends, a person can shake hands with
any number of other friends. Prove that there are at least two friends
who shook their hands with the same number of people. Start by stating
your proof technique and why you chose it. (2 points)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do it by Exhaustion:</strong> Due to their ongoing
rivalry, Atreya and Prad in their settlement chose to take half the set
of coords with them. Each coord from Atreya’s team chooses a best friend
from Prad’s team and vice versa, if two coords choose each other they
are considered mutual best friends. Prove that if there are infinitely
many coords, the probability that there are no mutual best friends is
<span class="math inline">\(\textstyle\frac{1}{e}\)</span>(3
points)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Torn realities:</strong> Show that if there cannot exist
any continuous map from the disk to its entire boundary then continuous
maps of the disk onto itself must have at least one fixed point. If you
don’t understand what this statement means, here is a <a
href="http://brandnew2000.github.io/mc/dc_web/add" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short read</a> to
help you out!(Bonus)</p></li>
