<h1 id="a-network-of-connections">A Network of Connections</h1>
<p>Graphs aren’t just for math—they’re everywhere! They help us
understand how things are connected and interact. A Graph is nothing but
like a network of friends. Each friend is a node and the connections
between them are represented by Edges. Here are a few definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vertices (or Nodes): These are the points in a graph. Think of
each person as a vertex.</p></li>
<li><p>Edges: These are the lines that connect two vertices. For example
an Edge shows that two people are friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Degree of a vertex: This tells us how many edges are connected to
a vertex. In other words, the degree of a person (vertex) is how many
friends they have.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Exploring Degree Sum and Number of Edges:</strong> Now
that we know what vertices, edges, and degrees are, let’s dig a little
deeper! Can you figure out how the sum of all degrees relates to the
total number of edges (friendships) in the network? In other words
Imagine you have a network of friends. Each person (vertex) has a
certain number of friends (degree). If we add up the number of friends
everyone has, how can we figure out the total number of friendships? (2

chessboard as a graph in which each square is represented as a node. An
edge connects two nodes if the knight can legally move from one square
to the other. Your goal is to investigate the characteristics of this
graph representing the knight’s movement!</p>

<p>You learnt about vectors in physics. Now let’s play with them in
math. Let us define an operator <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda:
\mathbb{V} \times \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{V}\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{V}\)</span> is what is called a vector
space and can be thought of as a domain comprising of vectors) which
operates on <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> vectors and satisfies
the following properties:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="sec:complex_int">Complex Integrals!</h2>
<p>Complex integrals are studied quite often in the world of complex
analysis. There exist a certain class of functions which behave very
nicely called ‘entire’ functions. An interesting property of these
functions is that they satisfy the relation: <span
class="math display">\[n(\gamma; a)f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi
i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{z - a}dz\]</span> Here <span
class="math inline">\(\int_{\gamma}\)</span> denotes a line integral
along the closed curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. If
you haven’t encountered line integrals in Sem 1 yet here is a quick
guide to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral#Complex_line_integral">line
integrals</a>. Line integrals find an enormous amount of use in
engineering. You may have encountered them in Ampere’s law in High
school.<br />
<br />
<span class="math inline">\(n(\gamma; a)\)</span> denotes the number of
times the closed curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> loops
around the point <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in the
counterclockwise direction. If the point <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> lies outside the curve <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(n(\gamma; a) = 0\)</span>. This quantity is what
is known as the <a
href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContourWindingNumber.html">winding
number</a> of a point with respect to a curve.<br />
<br />
If I tell you that the function <span class="math inline">\(f :
\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}, f(z) = \sin z\)</span> is an ‘entire’
function, can you try to evaluate the integral now?</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="sec:feynman">Feynman for ya!</h2>
<p>The Feynman method is a powerful technique often helpful in
evaluating tricky integrals. The technique involves the introduction of
a new variable and then differentiating under the integral using the
Leibniz rule to simplify the problem.<br />
<br />
<span> <strong>Example</strong>:</span><br />
Let’s say we wish to evaluate the integral:<br />
<br />
<span
class="math inline">\(\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{x}dx\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The main idea behind Feynman’s technique is to introduce something
that makes evaluation of the integral after differentiation simpler one
step in the future. We introduce an auxiliary term which on
differentiation would make the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in
the denominator vanish and make the integral easier to evaluate.<br />
<br />
We define:<br />
 <br />
<span> <span class="math inline">\(I(t) =
\int_0^{\infty}\frac{e^{-tx}\sin(ax)}{x}dx\)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\implies I&#39;(t) =
\int_0^{\infty}-e^{-tx}\sin(ax)dx =
-\left[\frac{e^{-tx}}{a^2+t^2}\left(t\sin(ax) - a\cos(ax)\right)
\right]^{\infty}_{0}\)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\implies I&#39;(t) = -\frac{a}{a^2 +
t^2}\)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\implies I(t) =
-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + c\)</span><br />
<br />
Note that <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \lim_{t \to \infty}
I(t) = 0 \text{, so } c = \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span><br />
<br />
Thus, </span></p>

<p>Mathematics thrives on proofs. Much like in life, where you don’t
quite believe your friend until they show you solid evidence to back up
their wild claims. Let’s explore some of the elegant (and occasionally
quirky) techniques that mathematicians love to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><del><strong>Proof by Intuition</strong></del> - All of us have
been there, when something just "feels" correct but we aren’t able to
prove it rigorously:) More formally this is known as a <strong>Direct
Proof</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proof by Induction</strong> - Surely you’ve heard of
this, the basic idea works by proving that if something holds for a
proposition (technical term for statement) P(n), prove
<del>somehow</del> that it holds for P(n+1) as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reductio ad absurdum</strong> - A fancy way of saying
proof by contradiction! Just tell your friend that he’s wrong and then
let him prove how he cannot be wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proof by Exhaustion</strong> - Yes you got that right, a
tiring method asking you to prove that something is true by showing that
it is true for each and every case that could possibly be
considered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proof by Contraposition</strong> - This is true because
our dear DC’s could prove it’s true. Help prove us right!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Providing a Counterexample</strong> - The most
sophisticated way of saying, ’you’re wrong!’<br />
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping these techniques in mind try to attempt the problems
given.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="sec:dr">Torn Realities</h2>
<p>This section has a lot for you to read. So bear with me! An
interesting ability of math is to describe the deformation of shapes
using the framework of algebra. A nice class of deformations are what
are called continuous deformations where we can shrink or twist the
shape but without tearing.<br />
<br />
Let us study the deformations of a disk onto the space occupied by
itself. A nice way to visualize this would be to imagine a piece of
elastic cloth cut into a circular shape which you deform along its area
without affecting its boundaries.<br />
<br />
Compactly one would write such a deformation as a map <span
class="math inline">\(f : D \to D\)</span> and say that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous. Here <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> refers to a closed disk, that is a disk
along with its boundary <span class="math inline">\(\partial D\)</span>.
Some intuitive observations that you can make about such continuous maps
are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(f : D \to D\)</span> is a
continuous map, then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x\)</span> for
atleast one point <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span>. Think of
this as there being at least one immovable point in any continuous map
from a disk onto itself. For example the rotation of the disk about its
centre has an immovable point - the centre itself.</p></li>
<li><p>There cannot exist an onto continuous map <span
class="math inline">\(g : D \to \partial D\)</span>. That is there does
not exist any continuous map from the disk to the entirety of its
boundary. You cannot stretch the interior of the elastic cloth to the
exterior without creating holes in it and ripping it apart!</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(h : D \to D\)</span> is a
continuous map, then all points in a neighbourhood of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> get mapped to a neighbourhood of <span
class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span>. That is all points close to each
other in the input space get mapped close to each other in the output
space. Otherwise remember the cloth analogy, you’ll be creating many
tears in it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You have to show that just as a consequence of (b) being true, (a)
must also now be true. Try to think along the lines of working in the
world of contra-positives. Imagine you have been transported into a
world by an evil villain where statement (a) is no longer true. Then I
want you to show that if continuous maps of the disk onto itself do not
have any fixed points, then you can construct a continuous map from the
disk to its entire boundary. You may ignore the fact that the monstrous
villain is still alive and you may or may not reach back home.</p>
